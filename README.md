## TODO

- Implement adding multiple satellites
- Implement adding multiple celestial bodies
- Need to figure out how to do floating origin for rendering 
(move origin point to currently viewed object (ie. earth or the any satellite)) to reduce jittering in motion
- Add UI to be able to spawn new bodies (both celestial and satellite)
  - Adding new body should pause simulation
  - 
- Add n-body dynamics
