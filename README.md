# astrolib-odin

## lil library for orbital mechanics and attitude dynamics for spacecraft


## TODO
- Implement adding multiple satellites
- Implement adding multiple celestial bodies
- Need to figure out how to do floating origin for rendering
  (move origin point to currently viewed object (ie. earth or the any satellite)) to reduce jittering in motion
- Add n-body dynamics
- Add UI to be able to spawn new bodies (both celestial and satellite)
  - Adding new body should pause simulation
  - add support for rotating frames
- Add different controllers
- Implement/fix locked camera view
  - currently only locks, cannot pan
