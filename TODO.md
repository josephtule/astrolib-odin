## TODO

- [x] Implement adding multiple satellites
- [x] Implement adding multiple celestial bodies
- [ ] Need to figure out how to do floating origin for rendering (and simulations)
      (move origin point to currently viewed object (ie. earth or the any satellite)) to reduce jittering in motion
- [x] Add n-body dynamics
  - [x] n-body for satellites
  - [x] n-body for celestial bodies
  - [x] add switch to control which model to use (lowest precision between two bodies, certain bodies may not have zonal spherical harmonic parameters)
- [ ] Add spherical harmonics
- [ ] Implement rotation vector for zonal (not negligible) and spherical harmonics
- [ ] Add Julian date and simulation current time
- [ ] Add UI to be able to spawn new bodies (both celestial and satellite)
  - [ ] Adding new body should pause simulation
  - [ ] add support for rotating frames
  - [ ] add picker for example configurations
- [ ] Add different controllers
- [x] Add different cameras (inertial/origin, satellite/body, fixed)
  - NOTE: currently only locks, cannot pan
  - [ ] adjust clipping planes dynamically depending on distance to target
- [x] Implement multiple buttons for camera movement
- [ ] Add orbit generating functions
  - [ ] classical orbital elements
  - [ ] n-body
- [ ] Add orbit data monitors
- [ ] Add example scenarios
- [ ] Add game states (paused, play, restart, etc.)
  - [x] paused
- [ ] Profile and speed up simulation
  - [ ] add multi-threading (separate translational and rotational dynamics?)
  - [x] different integrators
- [ ] Separate body/sat update and drawing from system
  - [x] separate updates
  - [ ] separate drawing
- [ ] Add rotation to celestial bodies?
  - [ ] Initial atittude -> set model rotation matrix, update using fixed rotation speed
  - [ ] Use angle-axis?
- [ ] Add flag to turn on/off attitude/rotational dynamics
- [ ] Add draw axes for celestial bodies
- [ ] Add celestial body constuctor
  - [ ] compute mass/mu depending on input
  - [ ] compute radii (semimajor, semiminor, mean) based on input
- [ ] Add tle reader and parser
- [x] Add celestial body model color
- [ ] Add visual scaling to models
- [ ] Add collision detection and resolution
  - [ ] collision detection
    - [ ] add spatial partitioning
  - [ ] collision resolution
    - should the bodies slide/bounce/etc.
    - idk how to do this, so far they have been hitting, sliding, then shooting off
- [ ] Add ability to change position vector origin
  - [ ] Show available origin targets (bodies and other satellites)
